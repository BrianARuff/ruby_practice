# Instance variables(attributes) are variables that belong to object
# Attributes provide info about the object's current state - a detail - description of an object
# Instance methods interact with the object. They also belong to the object.
# Encapuslation is a OOP concept that restricts direct access to an object.
# Blueprint/Template/Outline for an object
# Class is a like a factory for objects
# Object is an instance of the class
# Instantiation - process of creating object from class
# Class - abstract type because it hides the complexity of interacting with the
          # data much like a method abstracts the complexity of a process.
